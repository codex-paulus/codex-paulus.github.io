                    <p class="text-dark-gray">In our experience evaluating applicants is hard. Very hard. This is obvious when you think about it. How can you possibly understand such a complex thing as how someone will perform in a role by only interacting with them for minutes to hours (especially since both of you are putting on a show). We think most people know this but don't know how to do better so they continue doing it and dress it up with personality tests, gut feeling, what-would-you-do-if questions, and brain teasers. These may make us feel that we're being systematic and rigorous but they are really just crutches. Companies, including Google, have tested this and guest what they found out? The best prediction of job performance: sample work.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-gray">For many roles a realistic job sample doesnâ€™t fit into an interview process, but customer service is different. Here a job sample can be representative of actual work. Solving a real ticket is something that can be easily replicated in an interview. Meaningful, intelligent Customer Support is character driven. You want the people who can de-escalate, simplify complicated processes and manage unpredictable and unforeseen issues. Real life, real people, real troubleshooting. Solving actual tickets as part of the interview process allows you to spend less time talking to unqualified candidates and more time with the ones you want to hire.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-gray">This is the problem we're solving and we're building the software to do it in the most economical way possible. We think we have a better way of doing customer service interviews. One that will save you time and hire better agents.</p>
